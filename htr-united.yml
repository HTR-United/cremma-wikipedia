  The CREMMA-WIKIPEDIA project aims at creating a collection of ground truth to train
  HTR models on contemporary French handwriting.


  Each image represents an exerpt from a randomly selected Wikipedia page,
  copied by hand by volunteers. We then took care of the alignment between the
  handwritten portion and the original text, also present on the image.

  The transcription guidelines follow CREMMA's convention

  superscript is preceded by a ^. Strikethrough elements are transcribed with
  "><" when unreadable, ">word<" when readeable.  The text to copy may have
  included phonetic transcription. Non-french letters and diacritics were
  rendered as well.
